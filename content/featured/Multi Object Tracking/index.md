Currently pursuing a Computer Vision research paper on multi object tracking of soccer players from live broadcast videos. I hope to provide a platform to democratise sports analytics in soccer through easy access to match tracking data. This project is under the guidiance of Prof Dong [https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/bio/dongjs/]
